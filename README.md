Python Essentials 1 – Final Project

This repository contains my final project from the Cisco Python Essentials 1 course.
It’s a beginner-friendly project that helped me practice Python fundamentals such as:

Variables and data types

Loops and conditionals

Functions

Lists, tuples, and dictionaries

Error handling

Although the project is simple, it was a valuable learning experience.
I took longer than expected to complete it, which showed me I still have a lot to learn — but I’m proud I pushed through and finished it!
