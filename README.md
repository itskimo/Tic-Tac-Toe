Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A simple Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against the computer. The computer uses 'X' and you use 'O'. The computer always makes the first move in the center of the board.

#How to Play
The game starts with the computer placing an 'X' in the center square (position 5)

On your turn, enter the number of the square where you want to place your 'O'

The board is numbered from 1 to 9, left to right, top to bottom

The game continues until either:

You get three 'O's in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) - You win!

The computer gets three 'X's in a row - Computer wins!

All squares are filled with no winner - It's a tie!

Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer!
